# Version- Don't Change!
version: 1.0.0

# Important Note to EVERYONE:
# The border will set whatever your distance is away from the world spawn. Say my world spawn = 300, 56, 300 and my border size = 700. 
# The border will extend 175 from 300, meaning the "border" would be:  -475 ----- 125
#                                                                       |           |     # This meaning it expands 175 blocks in all directions
#    WorldBorder Plugin                                                 |  300,300  |     # If the border was 20, it would again expand 5 blocks each way

             # Selected World also Teleports Players to World's Default Spawn or Player Spawn Point. (If /setplayer spawn is executed, or bed is used)
